# YouTube Clone (HTML + CSS)

Hey there! This is a simple **YouTube Clone** I made using **HTML and CSS** — just for fun and practice.  
It’s a basic front-end project that helped me understand layout structure, styling, and responsive design.

## What I Built
- **Header:** includes YouTube logo, search bar, and icons  
- **Sidebar:** navigation links like Home, Trending, Subscriptions, etc.  
- **Video Section:** grid of video thumbnails with titles and channel info  
- **Basic Styling:** handled layout, spacing, hover effects, and overall UI feel  

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**

## What I Learned
- Structuring a web page like a real website  
- Using Flexbox and Grid for layout  
- Creating responsive sections  
- Writing clean, reusable CSS  

## Preview
*(You can add a screenshot of your clone here later!)*

## Future Improvements
- Add JavaScript for interactivity (like clicking videos or toggling sidebar)
- Make it fully responsive for mobile screens
